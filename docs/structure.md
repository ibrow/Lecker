# Structure of the Site

My thoughts about how to structure the site - sort of a brain dump.

* Homepage - logged in
** List of your most recently added links
*** title
*** url
*** description
*** tags
*** date added
** display a tag cloud, or list, I don't really likes clouds, for filtering
** search box - later
** button to add link
** link to account settings


* Account Settings
** by default private or public links
